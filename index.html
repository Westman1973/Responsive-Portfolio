      <p>Hello!!! My name is Sandy.  I am married to the military and a working mother of 2 busy kids. We are originally from Sherbrooke, Quebec.  My husband was posted to Trenton, Ontario 3 1/2 years and we have been living here ever since. Things I enjoy doing when alone are cooking, knitting and reading. I enjoy the peace and quiet whenever I can.  As as family, we enjoy boating, camping, and travelling. </p>
    </p>

      <p>I currently work for a medical cost containment company based out of Ottawa, Ontario.  My position there is Director of IT Solutions.  I love my job, the people I work with and the fact I get to work from home.  I am hoping to grow my techinical knowledge and skills by taking the Bootcamp Coding course to further assist me in my current role..</p>
